Final Project for COMP 307   
Make sure that you're using python3 to run your commands. I am using python 3.6.5 so try to match that
Follow this guide (replace all 'python' calls with 'python3' and Django version 3.0): [https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#pythonanywhere] to set up your virtual environment in your home\name directory (dont have it in the repo)
