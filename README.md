# COMP307_FinalProject
Final Project for COMP 307   
Make sure that you're using python3 to run your commands. I am using python 3.6.5 so try to match that
Follow this guide (replace all 'python' calls with 'python3' and Django version 3.0): [https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#pythonanywhere] to set up your virtual environment in your home\name directory (dont have it in the repo)

RUNNING:
To run this project make sure you have installed all libraries from requirements via 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (to find all libraries used in this project, look in requirements)
Next, make sure you have installed redis: https://redis.io/topics/quickstart and started the server: 'redis-server'.
The demo is straightforward and should be easy to replicate. To replicate the chat feature make sure the second user is on the same machine (due to localhost) and that they are not in the same session (use icognito).
